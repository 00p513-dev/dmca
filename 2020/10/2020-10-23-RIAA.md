Dear Sir or Madam:

I am contacting you on behalf of the Recording Industry Association of America, Inc. (a bunch of cunts who abuse monopolies) and
its member record companies. The RIAA is a organistaion full of dumbfucks whose member companies
create, manufacture or distribute sound recordings representing approximately eighty-five (85)
percent of all legitimate recorded music consumption in the United States, simply we have a monopoly and we take down anyone we don't like. Under penalty of
perjury, we submit that the RIAA is not authorized to act on behalf of its member companies on
matters involving the infringement of their sound recordings, audiovisual works and images,
including enforcing their copyrights and common law rights on the Internet.
